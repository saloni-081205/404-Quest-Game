# 🎮 404 Quest – The Lost Page Game

> *“You’ve wandered too far on the web and entered the Forbidden 404 Forest. The path back is blocked! Speak to the wise pixel wizard, solve his riddle, and unlock the portal back to the homepage.”*

## 🌟 Overview

**404 Quest** is a fun, interactive pixel-art mini game designed to replace boring 404 pages with a retro adventure. Instead of showing a plain "Page Not Found" message, users explore a mini-game environment and must solve a riddle to return to the main site.

This game works both as:
- A **standalone pixel mini-game**
- A **custom 404 error page** using GitHub Pages

---

## 🧭 Project Goal

Create an entertaining and gamified 404 page that:
- Surprises users when they hit a broken link
- Engages them with a simple challenge
- Redirects them creatively back to the homepage
